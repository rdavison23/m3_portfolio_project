          I was born in Ethiopia and moved to the U.S. when I was 11, bringing
          with me a love for creativity and craftsmanship. As an apparel designer,
          I have a sharp eye for color and textiles, plus solid experience in
          garment construction, pattern making, and styling. Now, I am diving into
          the digital world, learning to code with JavaScript and HTML. Blending
          fashion and technology opens up exciting new possibilities whether
          through interactive web experiences, e-commerce, or digital fashion
          projects. I am always eager to learn, push boundaries, and take on
          challenges with fresh ideas and determination.
